<h2>You asked :</h2>
<%= params[:question] %>
<%# The answer.html.erb will display the question you ask your coach as well as his answer.  %>
<%# The controller will need to read the question from params and compute an instance variable @answer for the view to display.
 Here are two requests that you should be able to handle: %>
 <%# localhost:3000/answer?question=hello
localhost:3000/answer?question=what time is it? %>

<h2>Coach answer :</h2>
<%= @answer %>

<%= link_to "ask again", "/ask" %>
